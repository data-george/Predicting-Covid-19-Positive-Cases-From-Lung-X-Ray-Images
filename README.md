Acknowledgments
Thanks to the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) for publicly providing the COVID-19 Chest X-Ray dataset [1] and would like to thank J. P. Cohen for taking the initiative to gather images from articles and online resources [2]. Finally to the Chest X-Ray Images (pneumonia) database in Kaggle for making a wonderful X-ray database for normal, viral and bacterial pneumonia images [3]. Also, a big thanks to our collaborators!
